This is just a small valid html5-structure including a css-reset and google's
reference-url( http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.6.0/jquery.min.js )
to version 1.6.0 of jQuery.

Thanks to John Resig & jQuery-Team for creating this nice framework. http://jquery.org/about/

Thanks to Eric Meyer for providing his css-browser-reset. http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/
